# RC_motor_propeller_test_bench
This Motor Test Equipment is specially designed to measure all vital parameters of RC motors + propellers.

On an RC plane, propeller performance depends on pitch, diameter, profile, and material.

Testing your propellers will allow you to measure and improve their efficiency.

This motor + propeller test equipment will measure:

Thrust
RPM
Current
Voltage
Electrical power
Temperature

It can be controlled either manually via a servo tester or your radio transmitter/receiver or automatically via your Android phone.
